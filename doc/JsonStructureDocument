AREA: names the json file
HELPS: UNKNOWN???
NPCS: Strings about a NPC
OBJECTS: Strings about a Object
ROOMS: Strings, and connect rooms by ID
RESETS: Commands that link everything together in theory. Each object needs to be batched dynamically since it seems like the resets objects only make sense in groups
SHOPS: UNKNOWN???
Case #1 (NPCS config in RESETS):
{
    {
      "action": "npc", <-- key command to create an NPC creation
      "id": 10538, <-- id of the NPC in the NPCS JSON
      "limit": 1, <-- an UNKNOWN limit of said npc in room???
      "room": 10500 <-- the id that the action NPC is in
    },
    {
      "action": "give", <-- key command to give (Assuming it is supposed to give to the most recent NPC action above)
      "id": 10538 <-- id of the object to give
    },
    {
      "action": "equip", <-- key command to equip (Assuming it is supposed to give to the most recent NPC action above)
      "id": 10500 <-- id of the object to give (NOTE: There is nothing in the json that differentiates objects as equip-able or not. You could be equipping gold coins here.)
      "slot": 5 <-- an UNKNOWN id that denotes something.
    }
}

Case #2 (objects in rooms config in RESETS):
{
    {
      "action": "object", <-- key command to spawn an object in a room
      "id": 10562, <-- id of the object
      "room": 10527 <-- room id where the object belongs
    },
    {
      "action": "put", <-- key command to put something into something ???
      "id": 10563, <-- id of the object
      "container": 10562 <-- does not follow the same flow as above where it is implied the object command before is the target.
    },
    {
      "action": "object", <-- and below are all repeated commands.
      "id": 10562,
      "room": 10527
    },
    {
      "action": "put",
      "id": 10563,
      "container": 10562
    }
}

Case #3 (door states config in RESETS. NOTE: These are bi-directional. From the json, it isn't possible to normally lock a door. ie. lock a door so people outside can't open but people inside can)
{
      "action": "door", <- key command for a door config
      "id": 3, <-- UNKNOWN (from what I can tell, it's not the index but an ordering. North = 0, East = 1, South = 2, West = 3)
      "room": 10526, <-- starting room I think
      "state": "locked" <-- string to enum probably since there was a closed state as well.
}
